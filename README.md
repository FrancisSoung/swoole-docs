# Swoole Docs

Swoole is an high-performance network framework uses an event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model makes it scalable and efficient. It is written in C language without 3rd party libraries.

It enables PHP developers to write high-performance, scalable, concurrent TCP, UDP, Unix Socket, HTTP, WebSocket services with PHP programming language without too much knowledge about non-blocking I/O programming and low-level Linux kernel.

Compare with other Async programming framework or software such as Nginx, Tornado, Node.js, Swoole has the built-in async, multiple threads I/O modules. Developers can use sync or async API to write the applications.

Swoole PHP network framework enhances the efficiency of R&D team, enable them to focus on the development of innovative products.

Swoole follows the same principle as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Netty](https://netty.io/), but for PHP.

The Swoole framework is released as a [PHP extension (PECL)](https://pecl.php.net/package/swoole) and runs as a PHP CLI application.


### Hello world

``` php
<?php
$http = new swoole_http_server("127.0.0.1", 9501);

$http->on("start", function ($server) {
    echo "Swoole http server is started at http://127.0.0.1:9501\n";
});

$http->on("request", function ($request, $response) {
    $response->header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    $response->end("Hello World\n");
});

$http->start();
```

Swoole client provides the API to write TCP/UDP/UnixSocket/HTTP clients, supports IPv4/IPv6 protocol. Developers can write sync or async client side features with swoole client API.

#### [Swoole Process Manager](/modules/swoole-process.md) {#entry_h2_2}

Linux process management module can be used to create new Linux process, manage the processes, and the communication between different processes.

#### [Swoole Async File I/O](/modules/swoole-async-io.md) {#entry_h2_3}

Async API includes the async File IO API, Timer, async HTTP client API, async MySQL client API,  async Redis client API and async DNS client API.

#### [Swoole MySQL Client](/modules/swoole-async-mysql-client.md) {#entry_h2_4}

The swoole async MySQL client is a replacement of the other sync MySQL clients: libmysqlclient, mysqlnd, mysqli.

#### [Swoole Redis Client](/modules/swoole-async-redis-client.md) {#entry_h2_5}

Swoole async Redis client is based on *hiredis*.

#### [Swoole Async Http/WebSocket Client](/modules/swoole-async-http-client.md) {#entry_h2_6}

Swoole Async HTTP client is a high performance and async HTTP client supports Http-Chun, Keep-Alive, form-data.

#### [Swoole Async Http2 Client](/modules/swoole-async-http2-client.md) {#entry_h2_7}

Http2.0 client support stream and multiplexing. Multiple GET or POST request can be sent over the same TCP connection.

#### [Swoole EventLoop](/modules/swoole-event-loop.md) {#entry_h2_8}

Developers can use Swoole EventLoop API to use the system EventLoop.

#### [Swoole Memory Management](/modules/swoole-memory.md)

#### [Swoole Atomic](/modules/swoole-atomic.md) {#entry_h2_9}

Integer variable allows any processor to atomically test and modify. Implemented based on CPU atomic instructions.

#### [Swoole Buffer](/modules/swoole-buffer.md) {#entry_h2_10}

The memory management module enables developers managing memory like C language without worrying about memory allocation, release.

#### [Swoole Table](/modules/swoole-table.md) {#entry_h2_11}
