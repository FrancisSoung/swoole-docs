It enables PHP developers write high performance, scalable, concurrent TCP, UDP, Unix Socket, HTTP, WebSocket services with PHP programming language without  too much knowledge about non-blocking I/O programming and low level Linux kernel.

Compare with other Async programming framework or software such as Nginx, Tornado, Node.js, Swoole has the built-in async, multiple thread I/O modules. Developers can use sync or async API to write the applications.

Swoole PHP network framework enhances the efficiency of R&D team, enable them focus on the development of innovative products.
